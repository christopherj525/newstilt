A mobile app for crowdsourcing data on political bias in the media

NewsTilt is a mobile app that crowdsources data on political bias in the media. It works by showing individuals a list of
articles and having them swipe left or right on the article depending on which direction they believe it leans.


## ROADMAP
1. Build a website of readme documentation for onboarding new developers
2. Add images/gifs to readme for demonstration
3. Launch on Android/iOS app stores
